    <h3>DOM is a JS representation of a webpage,
         just a representation of an actual document.</h3>
    <h3>it is just a bunch of objects that we can interact with via JS.</h3>
    <p>We can listen for any sort of event that a user could trigger and then 
        have some behavior that happens in response a user clicks .
    </p>
    <p>The Document object is our entry point into the world of the DOM.
        It contains representations of all the content on a page,
        plus tons of useful methods and properties.
