    <h1>loops - repeating code</h1>
    <p>We had variables than we had conditionals than we did data structures - arrays and objects.</p>
    <p>Now we have another really key piece to any programming language which is looping.</p>
    <p>We're going to see a bunch of different types of loops, different ways of repeating functionality or
        repeating logic in our scripts.
    </p>
    <p>After we'll cover different types of loops then we shift our focus to data structures with loops.
       Like if we were going to sum every number in an array we would need to loop or iterate once for each
       item in the array and add them into a total or a sum variable.
