        <li>what - A function is simply a reusable procedure.
            it's a chunk of code that we've wrapped up in a function, that we can call again at any point.
            We can refer back to it.
        </li>
        <li> First we define the function, It's kind of like registering it.</li>
        <li>Then the second step is to execute the function to run it and we can run it once or 100 times.</li>
        <li>metods are built in funct-s. It's already been defined or written for us.</li>
        <li>So to run it, Which is the second step, we need to call a function()</li>
